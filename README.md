# ICSE-7 Supplementary Code

Here I provide example MATLAB functions for the models developed in our contribution to the Proceedings of the International Conference of Spectroscopic Ellipsometry 7, which was published as a special edition of the journal Advanced Surface Science:

Nichols, S.; Arteaga, O.; Martin, T.; and Kahr, B.;  Partially coherent light propagation in stratified media containing an optically thick anisotropic substrate. Applied Surface Science, Vol. X, 2016.


The code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/shane-nichols/ICSE7-matlab.git).

Put the files into the MATLAB path and in the MATLAB command, run
```javascript
run ICSE7_RUNME
```

The code is explained in the comments:
```javascript
edit ICSE7_RUNME
```
A handy plotting utility, MMplot.m, is included. It makes publication quality figures with little effort :+1:

Enjoy!
